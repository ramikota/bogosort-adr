## Context and Problem Statement

The library system needs to be a scalable web application where users can register an account to become a library member, and from there they can browse, borrow, renew, and return books. The system must cater to several user actors, in this case these are guests, library member, branch librarians and system administrators. The system should support multiple channel actions, whether that be on desktop, mobile or in-branch.
